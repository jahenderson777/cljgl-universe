# A state-machine model of the universe operating on a set of discrete space points and energy points in an E3 meta-space.

### An attempt to model physics by spatially treating non-dimensionality in an E3 meta-space

### Interesting results while modelling a theory of everything involving dimensionally treated non-dimensionality in an E3 meta-space

## Intro
Einstein tells us that E = MC^2, that energy and matter are basically the same (not that you can convert one into the other, but that they are always fundamentally the same). General Relativity tells us that energy/matter alters the structure of the surrounding space, and that the movement of energy/matter is dictated by the surrounding space. The goal of GR has always been to describe all the fields & forces that we witness in the universe as nothing other than features/variances/inhomogeneities in space. However, the mathematics that was developed to describe this concept was unfortunately built on counter-intuitive concepts like a constant speed of light and 4D Minkowski spacetime, which although mathematically fairly successful, makes it impossible for the average human mind to grasp intuitively. Einstein even remarked “since the mathematicians pounced on the relativity theory I no longer understand it myself”,  it’s worth considering that remark deeply because it reveals that Einstein first had an intuitive understanding before any mathematics was developed. It is my standpoint that intuitive understanding is primary, and mathematics is only a tool and is secondary.  Unfortunately, for one reason or another, perhaps because we can’t mark an exam on intuitive understanding but we can on maths, the ability to work the mathematics has become primary and the intuitive understanding has become sidelined, even to the point when many physics teachers will claim that intuitive understanding for the human mind is out of bounds.

## So here’s the idea…
All philosophers through the ages who are worth their salt come to this same conclusion:
The simplest thing conceivable is nothingness, emptiness. However, this emptiness, by definition, has a dimensionality to it, it is an area with no thing in it. There is no thing over on the left, there is no thing over on the right, there is no thing in front of me, there is no thing above me, there was no thing a moment ago, there was no thing before that. But after some time one realises that because of this dimensionality, this area, it is still a something, there is an ‘over here’, an ‘over there’, a ‘moment ago’ and ‘I am conscious of it’. So if we ponder this we can realise (in the truest sense of the term) that there is a more truer emptiness than what we had first conceived, absolute void if you like, that does not even have dimensionality, it is not an expanse, it does not even have time, it is inaccessible to consciousness. Of course language itself breaks down here because even the word ‘void’ conveys an expanse of nothingness. Equally appropriate to the term ‘absolute void’ is ‘the opposite of space’, or ‘everything’. How funny it sounds to equate ‘everything’ to ‘absolute void’. I don’t think this is something our mechanical intellect can grasp, it needs to be intuited from a deeper part of ourselves. So all of a sudden, from thinking about nothing, we have two things: dimensional nothingness and true nothingness. And it is from the interplay, the compound, of these two that all things are made. Michelangelo produces his David from not just marble, but marble and empty space - if it was just marble the universe would only be an infinity of marble. All the wonders of the digital age subsist on an underlying structure of 1s and 0s.

It is said that cultures of the past did not accept zero as a number, and it was only when we did accept zero as a number, as good as any other (but with some interesting characteristics) that mathematics began to flourish. I think physics needs to make a similar revolution. The flourishing of mathematics came about when we treated the non-number zero, as a number; when we gave the non-number its own place on the number line. The flourishing of physics will be due to treating non-dimensionality as dimensionality, giving coordinates to that which does not have coordinates - what do I mean by that? I will explain in due course.

The mathematics of mainstream physics is built upon fixing the speed of light to be constant, however it is clear that this was contrary to Einstein’s intuition (see physicsdetective.com). If one tries to think of the speed of light as fixed, one is forced to vary something else to create the necessary inhomogeneity of space, that thing being time. Therefore in mainstream physics we talk of the topology of spacetime, that it is not ‘flat’ (to use the 2D analogue). Topology is like how a 2D person living on a 2D surface, even though they experience a 2D world, may live on a surface that is rolled up into a cylinder, or a donut, or a sphere, it may have bumps or dips causing straight lines that start parallel to not always stay a fixed distance from each other. For the 2D person the complex topology of the 2D surface is easily imagined by us because we can imagine the 2D surface as a 3D structure in our 3D world. The idea in the case of the 2D person is to employ a higher dimensional (3D) space to describe the topology of the 2D surface. So mathematicians chose to describe the inhomogeneity of space required by General Relativity by adding the dimension of time to our ordinary three dimensions to form a four dimensional spacetime, within this four dimensional spacetime, space is hilly (to use the 2D analogue). If this concept of four dimensional space makes you want to quit with a headache… I don’t blame you, because it’s the wrong idea. It’s an idea that kind of works mathematically (up to a point), but only so much as vintage planetariums were able to describe the motion of the planets in the sky despite thinking of the Earth as the centre of the universe. Apart from being impossible for the average human mind to comprehend, curved 4D spacetime misses the heart of the matter (I mean that in a double sense), and that is energy. The modern understanding of spacetime can’t explain energy (matter). Physics teachers draw lines on a Minkowski diagram representing a photon or an object in spacetime but they haven’t the foggiest idea what it is, there is just no explanation for it in the spacetime model.

To provide a much better description of General Relativity and to simply explain what energy actually is I propose there is no need for exotic higher dimensional spaces above the three dimensional Euclidean space that we know and love. Most physicists would have you believe that the human tendency (or necessity) to think in Euclidean space is a just an unfortunate consequence of our evolution, and that “it’s just a limitation we are stuck with but reality is much more complicated than that, you can’t hope to wrap your mind around it, just munge the equations and make do with these poor 2D analogies”.

Space is inhomogeneous (some areas are different than others, thicker or under more pressure for example) *and* it has a topology (straight lines that start parallel do not necessarily stay a fixed distance apart), *but* rather than pinching time to build a 4D spacetime, space itself exists within a meta-space that is our good old friend, regular Euclidean three dimensional space. We say meta-space because it is in some way transcendent of ordinary space, but it is still just regular 3D Euclidean space. Time is the progression from one state of space to the next, it is a completely different type of thing to spatial dimension. The entirety of the universe is only in one state at one point in time, and moves to the next state by the application of some simple function on the current state. Light most definitely does not move at a constant speed, it only moves at a constant speed relative to the homogeneity of the local space - and the idea that light only travels in straight lines is quite silly. At least I think this is a far better model than our current one.

It is fairly straightforward how to think of the space being inhomogeneous whilst still being situated within Euclidean 3 space, like we know the air pressure in the atmosphere of the Earth varies from place to place, but how are we to think of space as having a topology without requiring an additional dimension to situate it in. The answer is, just as mathematicians eventually realised that it would be more fruitful to treat the non-number zero just the same as any other number, and to give it a place on the number line, so we should treat non-dimensional nothingness in a spatial way. Now, one might object here and point out that what happened with zero was people realised there is another sense of number apart from the counting of things, i.e. it can be well argued that when counting sheep it is unreasonable to think of zero sheep, however when the temperature on your thermometer drops 1 degree below 1 degree it is very reasonable to consider that a number and call it zero. However, when you think about it, I am suggesting something along the same lines: just as we realised a higher sense of number where zero does make sense to be placed next to one, so I am suggesting a higher sense of three dimensional Euclidean space that includes both physical dimensional space and non-dimensional nothingness where non-dimensional nothingness is treated dimensionally. 

As in mathematics we think of the real number line as the ‘set of all real numbers’, i.e. although in a certain sense it is a continuum it is also a collection of distinct numbers (albeit an infinite one), so we can think of the space in the universe as consisting of a ‘set of three dimensional (x, y, z) points’, although I am suggesting that the actual x, y, z coordinates are coordinates in the meta-space not physical space. For example, to simplify things to one dimension, say your universe only consists of 7 space points in a line, at a particular instant in time they have coordinates in the meta-space of 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9. In the meta-space there is a gap of 4 between the ‘3’ point and the ‘7’ point, but in physical space 7 is just the next one along from 3, physical space is unaware of the gap of 4. (However this is not exactly measurable physical distance, which depends on the propagation of light). At the next instant those same 7 space points might have the meta-space coordinates of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (i.e. the gap has disappeared). From the point of view of physical space nothing has changed between the two intants, but from the point of view of meta-space there was a gap in the first instant but there wasn’t a gap in the second instant. Put another way, the points in physical space are only relative to each other (who is next door to me, who is two doors down), but the points in meta-space are given absolute values. You might ask, what is the point of the meta-space if there was no change from the perspective of physical space? The point is that the meta-space gives us the arena in which to describe non-dimensional nothingness in a dimensional way. So just as we described dimensional space in the meta-space by thinking of it as a collection of points with values in the meta-space, so we can describe non-dimensional nothingness in the meta-space by thinking of it as a collection of points with values in the meta-space. In the above example the first instant may have had non-dimensional nothingness points in the meta-space of 5, 6, 11, 12, and in the second instant those points could be 11, 12, 13, 14. In one sense this meta-space idea that includes both physical dimensional space and non-dimensional nothingness but in a dimensionalised way is seems like an difficult to grasp concept, but as we will see, because it is only our good old friend E3 it is very easy to get an intuitive feel for it (and visualise it).

This simply means that the meta-space is a regular 3D Euclidean space that contains a set of points representing dimensional physical space, and a set of points representing non-dimensional nothingness. If your rational mind is still complaining that you just can’t give non-dimensional nothingness dimensional values, may I gently remind you of the people who complained about the number zero, and point out that the dimensionality of non-dimensionality only exists in the meta-space, just as zero rightly doesn’t sit on the number line of counting numbers, but does sit very well on the real number line (which is a higher sense of number).

But although the analogy of our sense of number evolving to include zero conveys the point that our understanding of space could be similarly upgraded, it isn’t that good an analogy because zero only occupies one place on the number line, and I am suggesting that non-dimensional nothingness ought to be given a set of points in the meta-space, not just one point. I think there is another analogy from mathematics that is also helpful, and that is Georg Cantor’s revelation that even though there exists an infinity of rational numbers (ratios of two integers), there still exists countless many real numbers (numbers like Pi and e) between any two rational numbers. This is a very good example of how a 1 dimensional ‘space’, the space of rational numbers, can be set inside another ‘space’, of the very same dimensionality but with a higher fidelity. I think this analogy is so good that it might be suitable to call meta-space, the name of real-space.

## What’s the point?

So now we have this meta-space, and within it we have a set of points representing ordinary physical space, and a set of points representing non-dimensional nothingness. **I like to call the points of physical space dark points and the points of non-dimensional nothingness light points, so I’ll refer to them like that from now on**. The key point is that these points, the dark points and the light points, move around, they are not static. The idea is that there is a simple function that operates on all the points in the meta-space to tick it on to the next state. The next state is entirely determined by the current state, so in this way it is a state machine. The progression of states is time. If it sounds strange to think of time in such a discrete manner, it’s only as strange as thinking of a continuum as made up of points, which we have just done - in fact I wouldn’t be surprised if the manner of the increment is related to number of points (this may be infinite, but if so it is only an aleph-0 infinity, and not an aleph-1 infinity).

## What’s the function?

What the function is reveals itself when we think some more about what these dark points and light points are. The dark points are our ordinary physical dimensional space, and space *fills*. Much like air molecules fill a region, so the characteristic of dark points is to fill a region, although they are not in any way molecules or particles or quanta of energy, they are more abstract points. The simple way to get points to fill a region is to give them a repulsive characteristic, they move away from nearby points. So in the meta-space dark points have the characteristic of repulsion. The light points on the other hand are non-dimensionality, they are anti-space, this is the opposite of dimensionality, so instead of a repulsive characteristic they have an attractive characteristic. Dark points repel from other dark points, and dark points repel from light points. Light points attract towards other light points, and attract towards dark points. So the function is very simply that to get the next state of the points in the meta-space, you look at all the points and calculate a new position for each point. Each point’s new position is calculated by looking at its proximity to all other points. If you are calculating a dark point’s new position you move it away from nearby points, if you are calculating a light point’s new position you move it towards nearby points. This is essentially it, although there is some subtlety around how exactly ‘nearby’ is defined, it may be a simple inverse square law, or it may be something slightly different - and it may be that amount of attraction and repulsion is slightly different between dark and light points. The pseudo code is as follows:

```
for every point p
    for every other point q
        apply something like the inverse square law to the vector p->q to get the vector v
        if p is a light point
            set p’s new position to be p + v
        else
            set p’s new position to be p - v
```

I say ‘something like the inverse square law’ because something needs to be done about the situation (at least in my models) when p is a light point and q is also a light point very close to it, because a straight inverse square rule would result in p and q ending up very far apart.

So this is what I’ve been modelling, just in 2D to start with but the results are super interesting. It’s easy to get photons zooming around the screen of varying energy levels, and easy to see how particles evolve in the right conditions also.

## Initial state

Of course when modelling this we need to set the initial positions of the dark and light points, but I find that any sort of distribution gives good results. I normally just randomise the points in a trivial uniform way. 

## So what is energy then?

The light points are energy. In meta-space energy is the embedded space described by the set of light points. With the light points attract, dark points repel rule energy naturally propagates around the meta-space (and hence ordinary space) in clumps, these are quanta of energy. When a clump of energy forms in the meta-space a bubble of ordinary space forms around it (in the meta-space). Soon enough an imbalance appears where the nucleus clump of light points is closer to one edge of the bubble, the nucleus then steps towards the closer edge, then the edge steps further away, the nucleus steps again towards the edge and the edge steps away, thus the bubble forms a teardrop shape and start travelling in a certain direction. If the dark points are evenly spaced out (meaning space is homogenous) this direction will be a straight line, but if there is inhomogeneity the bubble will curve, turn & twist. One thing to note is that although there is a bubble in the meta-space, ordinary space is not aware of the bubble. These bubbles are photons. A large bubble is a shorter wavelength photon, because the bubble size doesn’t count in ordinary space this is the reason why high energy photons have a shorter wavelength which is somewhat counterintuitive. Because the dark points around a bubble are moving around a fair bit it is quite easy for a photon to get tied up in knots going around and around, these knotted photons are what we call massive particles.
